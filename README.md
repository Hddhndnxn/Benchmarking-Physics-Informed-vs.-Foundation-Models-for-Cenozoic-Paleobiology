![Download Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now%20%21-Click%20Here-brightgreen)

## 📖 Overview
This project benchmarks Physics-Informed Neural ODEs against Fine-Tuned Foundation Models (Chronos) on Cenozoic fossil data. It includes an analysis of the Lilliput Effect, focusing on climate compared to taphonomy drivers. Our results demonstrate that Neural ODEs outperform generic Transformers, achieving a mean squared error of 13.05 while reconstructing deep-time evolutionary history. This application serves as a research tool for those interested in computational paleobiology and scientific machine learning.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Benchmarks top models for paleobiological data analysis.
- User-friendly interface for exploring fossil data.
- Visual results for easy interpretation.
- Supports analysis of climate and taphonomy drivers.
- Detailed reporting on model performance and findings.
